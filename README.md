# Small Office Network Design & Implementation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

##  Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **small office network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
The network was built to simulate a real-world small business environment with **segmented VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, and static IP assignments** for critical services.  

The goal of the project is to showcase practical skills in **network design, configuration, and troubleshooting**, suitable for enterprise-level networking scenarios.

## Network Features
- **Multi-VLAN Architecture**  
  - VLAN 10: Admin  
  - VLAN 20: Sales  
  - VLAN 30: IT  
  - VLAN 40: Servers/Printers  

- **Router-on-a-Stick Inter-VLAN Routing**  
  Configured subinterfaces on the router with `802.1Q encapsulation` to enable communication between VLANs.  

- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**  
  - DHCP pools configured per VLAN.  
  - Gateway and server/printer addresses excluded.  

- **Switching**  
  - VLAN assignments for access ports.  
  - Trunk links between core switch and router/access switches.  
  - VTP used for VLAN propagation across switches.  

- **Static IP Services**  
  - File/Print Server (192.168.10.194)  
  - Network Printer (192.168.10.195)  

- **Scalability & Security Considerations**  
  - Network segmented by function for efficiency and security.  
  - Design can be extended with firewalls, VPNs, and wireless access points.
